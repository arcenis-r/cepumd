#' Calculate a CE weighted mean

#' @description Calculate a weighted mean using the method used to produce
#' official CE estimates.
#'
#' @param ce_data A data frame containing at least a finlwt21 column,
#' 44 replicate weight columns (wtrep01-44), a cost column, and a survey
#' indicator column. All but the survey column must be numeric.
#'
#' @return A 1-row dataframe containing the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item agg_exp - The estimated aggregate expenditure
#'   \item mean_exp - The estimated mean expenditure
#'   \item se - The estimated standard error of the estimated mean expenditure
#'   \item cv - The coefficient of variation of the estimated mean expenditure

#' records suppressed to protect respondent confidentiality, will not match the
#' published estimates released by the CE in most cases. The CE's published
#' estimates are based on data that are not topcoded nor have records
#' suppressed. You can learn more at
